# Algorithms-Session
Wednesday session about various important algorithms with pseudo code.
## Topic planning to cover
1) Analysis of algorithms and why they are important
2) Linear Search and Binary Search - Finding number of repetations of an element in an array
3) Linked List, Stack, Queue implementation
4) Application of stacks - Dijkstra's two stack algorithm
5) Application of queues - Priority Queue
6) Kadane's algorithm
7) Various different sorting and sorting efficiency
8) Insertion sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Quick sort
9) Applications of merge and quick sort

#### Create different folders for each programming language and put the code for the algorithm in it
#### Pseudo code and code in Java will be updated. Kindly convert the exact code into different languages because implementation should be based on how the pseudo code is explained
